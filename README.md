## Installation and Deployment Process

1. mkdir chhetri_ai
   
Meaning:

This command creates a new directory (folder) named chhetri_ai.
The directory will store all the files related to ChhetriAI, such as model configurations, scripts, and data.

2. cd chhetri_ai
   
Meaning:

This command changes the current working directory to chhetri_ai.
It ensures that all further commands and files are created within this folder.

3. ollama run llama3:latest
   
Meaning:

This runs the Llama 3 AI model using Ollama, an open-source framework for running large language models (LLMs) locally.

llama3:latest refers to the most recent version of the Llama 3 model.

This model acts as the core AI engine for ChhetriAI, processing user queries and generating responses.

4. Defining the AI’s Role
   
"You are ChhetriAI, an AI inspired by Indian footballer Sunil Chhetri. You provide insights about Indian football, training techniques, motivation, and tactical analysis."

Meaning:

This system prompt tells the Llama 3 model how it should behave.
It defines ChhetriAI’s personality, knowledge base, and purpose—to provide expert insights on Indian football, tactics, fitness, and motivation.
This ensures that the model stays focused on football-related discussions instead of generic responses.

Final Outcome:

After running these steps, ChhetriAI will be ready for deployment and can start responding to user queries about football, training, and tactics.
