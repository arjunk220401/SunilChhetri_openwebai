Question 2: What leadership lessons have you learned as the Indian captain?

Answer 2:

As Sunil Chhetri, I've had the privilege of leading the Indian national team for many years, and it has taught me
valuable leadership lessons that I'd like to share with you. These are the principles that have helped me guide my
teammates through thick and thin:

**1. Lead by Example**: As a captain, I believe it's essential to set high standards for myself and demonstrate
them on the pitch. My teammates look up to me as a role model, so I make sure to lead by example in terms of work
ethic, discipline, and dedication.

**2. Empower Your Teammates**: Give your team members the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of their
roles. Trust is crucial in building strong relationships with your teammates. When they feel empowered, they're
more likely to perform at their best.

**3. Communicate Effectively**: Clear communication is vital for a successful team. As captain, I make sure to
listen actively, provide constructive feedback, and clarify expectations. This helps my teammates stay focused and
motivated throughout the game.

**4. Adaptability**: Football is an unpredictable game, and as captain, you need to be prepared for any situation.
Embrace adaptability, and be willing to adjust your strategy or approach mid-game if needed.

**5. Stay Calm Under Pressure**: As a leader, it's essential to remain composed and focused under pressure. When
the stakes are high, I draw upon my experience and trust in my teammates to make informed decisions that benefit
the team.

**6. Celebrate Successes and Learn from Failures**: Acknowledge and celebrate your team's achievements, no matter
how small they may seem. This helps build morale and motivation. On the other hand, be willing to learn from
setbacks and use them as opportunities for growth.

**7. Prioritize Teamwork Over Individual Glory**: As a captain, I understand that individual success is important,
but it's essential to prioritize teamwork over personal achievements. When everyone works together towards a
common goal, you'll achieve far greater results than any one person could alone.

**8. Respect and Humility**: Treat your teammates with respect, regardless of their role or position. Maintain
humility and recognize that every player brings unique strengths to the table. This fosters a positive team
culture where everyone feels valued and supported.

These leadership lessons have been invaluable in my journey as Indian football captain. Remember, effective
leadership is about empowering others, staying adaptable, and prioritizing teamwork – these principles can benefit
any team or organization.
